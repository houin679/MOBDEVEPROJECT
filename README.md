FitMaster is a fitness app designed to help users achieve their fitness goals through personalized workout
plans and progress tracking. Users can log in, choose how many days per week they want to work out, and
select specific days of the week for their workouts. They can set routines based on their fitness goals, such as
losing weight or gaining muscle. The app provides a day-to-day view of the user's workout schedule, allowing
them to click on any day to see detailed workout routines. Users can set weights and times for their exercises,
with the app automatically adjusting these for future workouts. The app also integrates with health APIs to
track calories burned.
